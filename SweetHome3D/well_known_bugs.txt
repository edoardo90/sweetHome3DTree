	1) NEED FOR REFRESH
	
	file -> open recent -> *filename*.sh3d
	there is need to refresh before using objects
	
	if I open a sw3d file from recent files (or even normally from file -> open)
	and I do NOT refresh then if I double click an object the id field is blank cause
	the graph is not updated.

		Way out:
		after opening a file press Refresh button (the one with blue arrows)
